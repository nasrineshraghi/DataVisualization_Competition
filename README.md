# GENDER GAP in CANADA: 
# Equal Access doesn't equate to Equal Pay! But Why?
For the University of New Brunswick "Data Visualization Competition 2021" we have chosen to focus on the United nation's sustainable development goal (SDG) number 5 Gender Equality. Freely available data from "https://www.statcan.gc.ca/" was used for the purpose of this limited study.


Canada was ranked 24th by the UN based on it's performance according to the Global Gender Gap Index (GGI) for the year 2021. Unsurprisingly this year the war torn country of Afghanistan performs the worst while the scandinavian countries led by Iceland continue to maintain their stronghold when it comes to striving for equality.

Four metrics are used for estimating the gender gap index: a) Political empowerment, b) Educational attainment, c) Health and survival, d) Economic participation and opportunity.
