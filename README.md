# GENDER GAP in CANADA: 
## Equal Access doesn't equate to Equal Pay! But Why?
For the University of New Brunswick "Data Visualization Competition 2021" we have chosen to focus on the United nation's sustainable development goal (SDG) number 5 Gender Equality. Freely available data from "https://www.statcan.gc.ca/" was used for the purpose of this limited study.

Canada was ranked 24th by the UN based on it's performance according to the Global Gender Gap Index (GGI) for the year 2021. Unsurprisingly this year the war torn country of Afghanistan performs the worst while the scandinavian countries led by Iceland continue to maintain their stronghold when it comes to striving for equality.

Four metrics are used for estimating the gender gap index: a) Political empowerment, b) Educational attainment, c) Health and survival, d) Economic participation and opportunity. Canada's performance has reached parity in the education and health sectors but lags significantly in political empowerment. Economy that is inherently related to education and social factors is still an area of concern with a score of 0.74. We are particularly interested if the **good numbers in health and education also show up in their economic contribution**. 

The correlation between a country's economy and it's gender equality indices is well known and can be seen clearly in the figure below. Exceptions to this exist where social factors can have a significant impact like the rich east asian countries of Japan and Korea. Hence to address a country's  gender disparity it is really important to focus on the economic conditions. Hence we chose to look at the simpler gender pay ratios for our study.

In the last decade the median gender annual pay ratio in Canada has an overall upwards trend. The correlation between the state of the economy and the pay ratio is apparent with dips coinciding with the recent oil crisis. It is important that we look at the total pay ratios and not just the wage ratios since it is the total income which matters more than the theoretical parity in wage rates. The median income which was lower than the average income for men was CAD 43K while women earned $12.5K less at just CAD 31.5K. The number looks even more stark when one notices that the contribution of women to the labor force is now almost equal to that of men which means that there are a lot more women earning less than men now.
