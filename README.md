# GENDER GAP in CANADA:

## Equal Access doesn't equate to Equal Pay! But Why?
For the University of New Brunswick "Data Visualization Competition 2021" we have chosen to focus on the United nation's sustainable development goal (SDG) number 5 Gender Equality. Freely available data from "https://www.statcan.gc.ca/" was used for the purpose of this limited study.

Canada was ranked 24th by the UN based on it's performance according to the Global Gender Gap Index (GGI) for the year 2021. Unsurprisingly this year the war torn country of Afghanistan performs the worst while the scandinavian countries led by Iceland continue to maintain their stronghold when it comes to striving for equality.

Four metrics are used for estimating the gender gap index: a) Political empowerment, b) Educational attainment, c) Health and survival, d) Economic participation and opportunity. Canada's performance has reached parity in the education and health sectors but lags significantly in political empowerment. Economy that is inherently related to education and social factors is still an area of concern with a score of 0.74. We are particularly interested if the **good numbers in health and education also show up in their economic contribution**. 


**Economy affects pay disparity**
The correlation between a country's economy and it's gender equality indices is well known and can be seen clearly in the figure below. Exceptions to this exist where social factors can have a significant impact like the rich east asian countries of Japan and Korea. Hence to address a country's  gender disparity it is really important to focus on the economic conditions. Hence we chose to look at the simpler gender pay ratios for our study.

In the last decade the median gender annual pay ratio in Canada has an overall upwards trend. The correlation between the state of the economy and the pay ratio is apparent with dips coinciding with the recent oil crisis. It is important that we look at the total pay ratios and not just the wage ratios since it is the total income which matters more than the theoretical parity in wage rates. The median income which was lower than the average income for men was CAD 43K while women earned $12.5K less at just CAD 31.5K. The number looks even more stark when one notices that the contribution of women to the labor force is now almost equal to that of men which means that there are a lot more women earning less than men now.

**Gender defined industries**
If we look closer at the province wide distribution of median gender pay ratios, we would notice that historically prvinces like Alberta and Newfoundland (NFL) have worse gender parity parameters as compared with Quebec and Ontario. A quick look at the contribution of various occupational sectors that drive the GDP of a province provides some clues. For example in Quebec and Ontario the number of companies in the financial and management sector is high contributing to almost 30% to the GDP while on the other hand the prvinces of Alberta and New Foundland and Labrador have a greater share from mining and oil based industries. There seems to be a correlation between this and the lower gender parity numbers for NFL

One might wonder why does this disparity exist in some occupations more than others. The bar chart below shows the gender pay ratios across different occupations grouped according to the National occupational classification (NOC). It is quite clear that the industries that require remote work in harsh conditions like transport or exploitation of natural resources do not pay the same to women as men. Historical gender roles that have shaped the minds of individuals over millenia leads to this bias that becomes apparent when we start looking at the interest in studying these subjects in the last section

**Health sector income disparity** 
Of the four criteria that are used to calculate the global gender gap index health is a sector which seems to be doing really well alongwith education. But when we look at the gender wage ratio in the health sector the picture is much less than rosy. The GGI for health is 0.96 but the total income ratio is only 0.77. This becomes alarming when we factor in that the total number of women healthworkers outnumber men by a 3:1 ratio !! Even though the wages have become more or less equal over the years, but the total income of women still is not at par with men. One major factor in this is the number of hours women work on averaged as compared with men. Since there is a greater proportion of women who are employed part-time or are not able to work long hours like men can affects their total income. Due to this disparity in the total number of hours worked the average income drops for women since men are able to work long hours. Various factors affect the lower work hours for women including but not limited to lack of daycare facilities, support from family, marital status and the number of children.

**Education sector income disparity: Field of Education matters:**
The earning capacity of an individual is inherently related to their level of education. But, unfortunately not all education pays equally. In the last few years we have not only reached gender parity in the number of female graduates, but in certain fields women now far outnumber men. The traditional imbalance in STEM has reduced at a slow pace while female domination in education has only increased. This disparity in the field of study combined with the lower rate of pay in education as compared to STEM disciplines means that highly educated females end up earning far less than men.

This disparity in STEM is well known and several measures are already in place. One area where pay transparency and general encouragement of women has results is in the number of faculties at universities which has now reached parity. The lack of role models, society defined gender roles across different ethnic groups, direct or indirect discrimination all affect this. 

Overall even though the gender gap index numbers seem quite flattering, but a reality check is given by the economic disparity that extends to both health and education sectors. But, the good news is that many of the active interventions are now yeilding positive results. Attention now needs to be paid so that we can improve the number of average work hours for women by providing the right support structure and making sure that while we are paying attention to women we do not let young men feel discriminated and arrest their falling rate of education. Thus we believe "equal access" to resources along with ideal work enviroments will eventually lead to "equal pay" and end gender based disparity in income.
